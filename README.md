## About

`StructuralIdentifiability.jl` is a Julia package for assessing structural parameter identifiability of parametric ODE models, both local and global.
This includes computation of identifiable functions of states and parameters. The package also offers functionality to assess local identifiability
in discrete-time models.
For an introduction to structural identifiability, we refer to [[2]](#review).

## How to install

The package can be installed from this repository by

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("StructuralIdentifiability")
```

## Tutorials and Documentation

For information on using the package,
[see the stable documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/StructuralIdentifiability/stable/). Use the
[in-development documentation](https://docs.sciml.ai/StructuralIdentifiability/dev/) for the version of
the documentation, which contains the unreleased features.

## How to use

The package can be loaded by `using StructuralIdentifiability`.

### Defining a system

A parametric ODE system in the state-space from can be defined by the `@ODEmodel` macro:

```julia
ode = @ODEmodel(
    x1'(t) = -(a01 + a21) * x1(t) + a12 * x2(t) + u(t),
    x2'(t) = a21 * x1(t) - a12 * x2(t) - x3(t) / b,
    x3'(t) = x3(t),
    y(t) = x2(t)
)
```

In this example:

  - `x1(t), x2(t), x3(t)` are the **state variables**, they defined the state of the system and are assumed to be unknown;
  - `u(t)` is the **input/control variable** which is assumed to be known and generic (exciting) enough;
  - `y(t)` is the **output variable** which is assumed to be observed in the experiments and, thus, known;
  - `a01, a21, a12, b` are unknown scalar **parameters**.

Note that there may be mulitple inputs and outputs.

### Assessing identifiability

The identifiability of the parameters in the model can be assessed by the `assess_identifiability` function as follows

```julia
assess_identifiability(ode)
```

The returned value is a dictionary from the parameter of the model to one of the symbols

  - `:globally` meaning that the parameter is globally identifiable
  - `:locally` meaning that the parameter is locally but not globally identifiable
  - `:nonidentifiable` meaning that the parameter is not identifiable even locally.

For example, for the `ode` defined above, it will be

```
Dict{Any, Symbol} with 7 entries:
  a12 => :locally
  a21 => :globally
  a01 => :locally
  b   => :nonidentifiable
  x2  => :globally
  x1  => :locally
  x3  => :nonidentifiable
```

If one is interested in the identifiability of particular functions of the parameter, one can pass a list of them as a second argument:

```julia
assess_identifiability(ode, funcs_to_check = [a01 + a12, a01 * a12])
```

This will return:

```
Dict{Any, Symbol} with 2 entries:
  a12 + a01 => :globally
  a12*a01   => :globally
```

### Assessing local identifiability

Local identifiability can be assessed efficiently even for the models for which global identifiability analysis is out of reach.
This can be done using the `assess_local_identifiability` function, for example:

```julia
assess_local_identifiability(ode)
```

The returned value is a dictionary from parameters and state variables to `1` (is locally identifiable/observable) and `0` (not identifiable/observable) values. In our example:

```
Dict{Nemo.fmpq_mpoly, Bool} with 7 entries:
  a12 => 1
  a21 => 1
  x3  => 0
  a01 => 1
  x2  => 1
  x1  => 1
  b   => 0
```

As for `assess_identifiability`, one can assess local identifiability of arbitrary rational functions in the parameters (and also states) by providing a list of such functions as the second argument.

**Remark** The algorithms we used are randomized, the default probability of the correctness of the result is 99%, one can change it by changing the value of a keyword argument `p` to any real number between 0 and 1, for example:

```julia
# pobability of correctness 99.9%
assess_identifiability(ode; p = 0.999)
```
