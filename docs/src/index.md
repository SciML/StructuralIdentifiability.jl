`StructuralIdentifiability.jl` is a comprehensive toolbox for assessing identifiability parameters.

## Installation

To install StructuralIdentifiability.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("StructuralIdentifiability")
```

## Feature Summary

`StructuralIdentifiability.jl` can assess local and global identifiability of ODE models. In addition to these straightforward identifiability queries on individual parameters, the package can distinguish between single- and multi-experiment identifiability.

## Feature List

  - Local identifiability checks
  - Global identifiability checks
  - Assessment of identifiable functions of parameters and states
  - Model reparametrization (experimental)
