# StructuralIdentifiability.jl

`StructuralIdentifiability.jl` is a comprehensive toolbox for assessing identifiability parameters.

This documentation contains information about the functionality of the package as well as examples of use cases.

## Installation

To install StructuralIdentifiability.jl, use the Julia package manager:

```julia
using Pkg
Pkg.add("StructuralIdentifiability")
```

## Citation
```latex

## Feature Summary
`StructuralIdentifiability.jl` can assess local and global identifiability of ODE models. In addition to these straightforward identifiability queries on individual parameters, the package can distinguish between single- and multi-experiment identifiability.
## Feature List
* Local identifiability checks
* Global identifiability checks
* Assessment of identifiable functions of parameters
