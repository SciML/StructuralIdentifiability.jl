# Global Identifiability of Differential Models

In this tutorial, let us cover an example problem of querying the ODE for globally identifiable parameters.

## Input System

Let us consider the following four-dimensional model with two outputs:

$\begin{cases}x'(t) = lm - d \, x(t) - \beta \, x(t) \, v(t),\\
    y'(t) = \beta \, x(t) \, v(t) - a \, y(t),\\
    v'(t) = k \, y(t) - u \, v(t),\\
    w'(t) = c \, x(t) \, y(t) \, w(t) - c \, q \, y(t) \, w(t) - b \, w(t),\\
    z'(t) = c \, q \, y(t) \, w(t) - h \, z(t),\\
    y_1(t) = w(t),\\
    y_2(t) = z(t)\end{cases}$

This model describes HIV dynamics[^1]. Let us run a global identifiability check on this model to get the result with probability of correctness being `p=0.99`. To do this, we will use `assess_identifiability(ode, p)` function.

Global identifiability needs information about local identifiability first, hence the function we chose here will take care of that extra step for us.

```@repl
using StructuralIdentifiability

ode = @ODEmodel(
    x'(t) = lm - d * x(t) - beta * x(t) * v(t),
    y'(t) = beta * x(t) * v(t) - a * y(t),
    v'(t) = k * y(t) - u * v(t),
    w'(t) = c * x(t) * y(t) * w(t) - c * q * y(t) * w(t) - b * w(t),
    z'(t) = c * q * y(t) * w(t) - h * z(t),
    y1(t) = w(t),
    y2(t) = z(t)
)
global_id = assess_identifiability(ode, 0.99)
```

We also note that it's usually inexpensive to obtain the result with higher probability of correctness. For example, taking `p=0.9999` in the system above will result only in a slight slowdown.

## Note on the probability of correctness

Currently, the probability of correctness does not include the probability of correctness of the modular reconstruction for Groebner bases. 
This probability is ensured by an additional check modulo a large prime, and can be neglected for practical purposes. However, in the future versions, we plan to 
eliminate this possible error.
